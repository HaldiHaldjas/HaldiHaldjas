- 👋 Hi, I’m @HaldiHaldjas
- 👀 Most of time I deal with web developing (Javascript, React). I am also very interested in UI/UX development.  
- 🌱 I am a career changer: from journalism/communication/politology to IT. 
- 🌱 I have been learning software development since June 2022.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning software development in Kehtna Kutsehariduskeskus (vocational school in Estonia).
- 🌱 I have also experienced z01 Talent in kood/Jõhvi programming school. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate mostly on web development.
