- 👋 Hi, I’m @HaldiHaldjas
- 👀 Most of time I deal with web developing (Javascript, React, React native and Expo). I am also very interested in UI/UX development.
- Currently working on a mobile app for gardening that should help many organic gardeners and homesteaders to maintain their oases more effectively. 
- 🌱 I am a career changer: from journalism/communication/politology to IT. 
- 🌱 I have been learning software development since June 2022.
- 🌱 I have graduated software development studies in Kehtna Kutsehariduskeskus (vocational school in Estonia).
- 🌱 I have also experienced z01 Talent in kood/Jõhvi programming school and CHOOSE-IT very practical course in BCS Koolitus. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate mostly on web development. 
- 📫 Contact me through my Github profile. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have also studied heritage technologies, so I know how to weave viking age fabrics etc.
